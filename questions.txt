    int a = 20;
    printf("%c%c%c%c", a);

Why is the output like this? @ï¿½P

In my opinion, the int take 32 bits in the computer and char take 8 bits, so the output should be 0 0 0 20?

    char *a = (char*)malloc(sizeof (char));
    printf("the size of the string is : %d\n", sizeof(a));
    printf("the size of char is : %d\n", sizeof(char));
    printf("the length of the string is :%d", strlen(a));
    scanf("%s", a);
    printf("the size of the string is :%d\n", sizeof(a));
    printf("the length of the string is :%d", strlen(a));
    free(a);

the size of the string is : 8
the size of char is : 1
the length of the string is :0
qwqw
the size of the string is :8
the length of the string is :4


Why does the a array alway 8 size?
